# House_Price_Prediction
In this project I have built a basic price prediction model using linear regression algorithm. I have used a dataset from Kaggle of Banglore house prices to train the model and then predict a price of a house by asking user for features like location, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms and square foot area. I have achieved roughly 85% accuracy from the model.
